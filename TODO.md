# ToDo

### Important

- create formatting metrics according to rendering order for every node: https://github.com/PyCQA/baron/blob/master/baron/render.py#L114
 i.e., format code with specific style, distinct for every developer
 
- format any node with gathering metrics

- format whole module with gathering metrics

- set default style as PEP8 like in yapf: https://github.com/google/yapf/blob/master/yapf/yapflib/style.py
